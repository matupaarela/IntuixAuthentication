# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[0001-module-feature]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `.specify/specs/[0001-module-feature]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Feature scope, plan, and source layout honor `Api -> Application -> Domain`.
- The feature lives under `.specify/specs/[0001-module-feature]/` and follows the canonical naming scheme.
- Security, tenant isolation, and sensitive-data handling are explicitly addressed.
- Required tests, migrations, logging, and documentation impacts are identified.
- Any constitution deviation is recorded in Complexity Tracking with a written justification.

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

**Structure Decision**: Use the active `.specify/specs/[0001-module-feature]/`
directory as the feature workspace and keep source code in the repository root
solution layout defined by the constitution.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
